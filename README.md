# Indoor Occupancy Regression using Mamba Architecture

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for indoor occupancy regression modeling using a Mamba-based deep learning architecture. The model predicts the number of occupants in a room based on historical sensor and environmental data.

## Key Features
- Occupancy Number Regression
- Mamba architecture: sequence modeling with state-space models
- Time series preprocessing including normalization and sequence generation
- Model evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² metrics
- Includes training loop, loss visualization, and performance summary

## Requirements

```
torch
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
notebook
```


## Dataset Info
This model was trained on occupancy time-series data from an indoor room setting, including features like:
- Hour of the day
- Relative humidity
- Temperature
- Previous occupancy values


## Visualization
- Model loss curve
- Predicted vs. actual occupancy scatter plots

## Acknowledgements
This project was developed as part of a research study on occupant-centric building control and deep-learning methods for indoor occupancy estimation.

```python
import torch
from torch import nn

class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(input_size, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)
```
